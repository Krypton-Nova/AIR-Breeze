## CHANGELOG


**WIP v1.6 (2018/04/??)**

* Re-enabled [C]. It now opens the first 10 endorsers. This satisfies NS script rules as [C] is not intended to be pressed more than once a minute.
* Fixed the issue with trying to open the WA-Delegate's page using [W] immediately after changing regions.


**v1.5 (2018/04/17)**

* Disabled [C] as it broke the rules for automated tools. Extensions are not allowed to open more than 10 tabs per minute.
* Renamed the "Pilot" regional officer role to "Ace". It sounds better overall I think.
* A few things that aren't all that noteworthy have been fixed: the extension didn't need tabs permission, the keyboard layout image has been updated, the link to it from the full readme works again, and corrected a minor mistake in the CSS.


**v1.4 (2018/04/12)**

* Added [S] to go to Spear Danes
* Added [O] for regional officer key shortcuts (opens regional controls, appoints own nation with A-C-E-P, dismisses other nations when modifying)
* Added [P] to go to The Pareven Isles
* Re-purposed [B] for banning nations
* Added version to full readme and popup
* Made proper HTML page for full readme
* Improved looks


**v1.3 (2018/03/19)**

* Squashed a bug where if you pressed [J] or [L] to leave the WA it would press the wrong button and take you to https://www.nationstates.net/page=login


**v1.2 (2018/03/18)**

* Published


**v1.1 (2018/03/16)**

* Changed [W] to go to region's page if not already there
* Changed [D] to also be able to doss regions


**v1.0 (2018/03/15)**

* Forked from Breeze++
* Added a popup readme (left-click the extension's button) and extension icon
* Added a keyboard layout image (see popup readme)
* Added [Backspace] to go to the previous page
* Added [F7] to go to the previous page
* Added [F8] to go to the next page
* Added [J] to apply/join/leave the WA
* Added [L] to apply/join/leave the WA
