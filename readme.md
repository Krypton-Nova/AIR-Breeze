## CHANGELOG

**v2.2 (2019/06/13)**

* Hotfix to disable extension in input fields.


**v2.1 (2019/06/13)**

* Disabled extension on forum.nationstates.net


**v2.0 (2019/06/12)**

* Added features from Breeze++ v3.0.0 (Author: Vincent W. Drake)
* Re-enabled [Z] (Zombie Control)


**v1.9 (2019/06/11)**

* Show currently selected jump point in extension popup
* Added [Shift]+[P] to set custom region.
* Changed [P] from By the Sword to custom region.


**v1.8 (2018/08/26)**

* Changed [P] from The Pareven Isles to By the Sword.


**v1.7 (2018/07/09)**

* Name changed from AIR-Breeze to Storm. Icons changed.


**v1.6 (2018/04/28)**

* Added [F6] to copy the link to the current page
* Re-enabled [C]. It now opens the first 10 endorsers and can not be used more than once a minute. This satisfies NS script rules.
* Added a visual aid for reloading the reports page, and automatically set "Show reports from last ... hours" to 0.10
* Fixed the issue with trying to open the WA-Delegate's page using [W] immediately after changing regions.
* Solved the inherent browser problem with cached previous/next pages. If you use F7 or Backspace and F8 to navigate, you won't need to reload the page any more. You still have to reload the page if you use the back/forward buttons in your browser. This is so that AIR-Breeze does not interfere with basic browser functionality
* Published on https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/air-breeze/dbmojgocnaeejbjnjgkcpehdpgjnhhpo


**v1.5 (2018/04/17)**

* Disabled [C] as it broke the rules for automated tools. Extensions are not allowed to open more than 10 tabs per minute.
* Renamed the "Pilot" regional officer role to "Ace". It sounds better overall I think.
* A few things that aren't all that noteworthy have been fixed: the extension didn't need tabs permission, the keyboard layout image has been updated, the link to it from the full readme works again, and corrected a minor mistake in the CSS.


**v1.4 (2018/04/12)**

* Added [S] to go to Spear Danes
* Added [O] for regional officer key shortcuts (opens regional controls, appoints own nation with A-C-E-P, dismisses other nations when modifying)
* Added [P] to go to The Pareven Isles
* Re-purposed [B] for banning nations
* Added version to full readme and popup
* Made proper HTML page for full readme
* Improved looks


**v1.3 (2018/03/19)**

* Squashed a bug where if you pressed [J] or [L] to leave the WA it would press the wrong button and take you to https://www.nationstates.net/page=login


**v1.2 (2018/03/18)**

* Published on https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/air-breeze/


**v1.1 (2018/03/16)**

* Changed [W] to go to region's page if not already there
* Changed [D] to also be able to doss regions


**v1.0 (2018/03/15)**

* Added a popup readme (left-click the extension's button) and extension icon
* Added a keyboard layout image (see popup readme)
* Added [Backspace] to go to the previous page

* Changed [B] to relocate to The Pareven Isles instead of Spear Danes
* Removed [V] as an alternative key to doss
* Removed [<] to go back ([F7] and [Backspace now serve that function])

* Disabled [Z] to open zombie control (will be re-enabled around halloween)
* Disabled [?] to file GHR (may be re-enabled by popular request)
